See the pdf for our entire problem set submission. The code is attached at the end of the document. 
This document is self-contained enough to grade our problem set. We've also attached our code in a zipped folder. 

Code:

run_main.ipynb is a Jupyter notebook which contains every part of the problem set. 

estimate_BLP.py is a Python script which runs one estimation of BLP. Feeding in various arguments to this function allows us to run every BLP estimation in the problem set. 

source_functions.py contains functions used in estimate_BLP.py as well as functions used for the first part of the problem set (histograms) and the merger exercise. 

utils.py contains some functions for extracting results from the dictionary output of estimate_BLP.py and saving them as .xlsx or .tex files
