ACF and GNR estimation coded in Python.

*main.py: runs the estimation. 

*ACF_GNR_estimation_functions.py: contains the functions for estimationg ACF and GNR. 

*source_functions.py: contains helper functions such as 
	-- Polynomial design matrix creation
	-- Linear regression 
	-- ACF and GMM moment errors and objective function
	
* For more exposition on the methods we used, see the folder jupyter_notebooks_for_exposition
* We tried joint ACF estimation, but could not get it to work due to time constraints
